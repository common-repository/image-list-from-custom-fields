Thank you for downloading the image list from custom fields plugin!

== Description ==

The “Image List From Custom Fields” plugin displays a list of images from a recent number of posts and links back to them. This plugin is similar to other image list plugins with one main difference, instead of causing increased server load by searching for and pulling an image from the post it pulls the image from the custom fields specified by the author when he/she writes the post. By doing this a much clearer image can be displayed rather than showing a stretched or skewed image from the post.

== Installation ==

   1. Download the plugin - Looks like you've already done this.
   2. Upload the custom-image-list.php file to the plugins directory of your Wordpress blog.
   3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in wordpress.
   4. Insert the following code into your header (or sidebar with some customization)

<?php if (function_exists('get_custom_image_list')) { get_custom_image_list(); } ?>
